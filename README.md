⚠️ **Important details**
- The opening fence must be: <code>```text</code>
- The closing fence must be: <code>```</code>
- No extra characters before or after
- Do **not** indent the fences

---

## ❌ What to remove from your current file

Delete:
- The **inline tree text**
- The **duplicated second copy**

Anything that looks like this **outside** a code block must go:


---

## ✅ What the Preview should look like after

You should see:
- A **monospaced tree**
- Proper vertical alignment
- No wrapping
- No duplication

Exactly like your `engineering-research-wiki` README.

---

## Rule to remember (this will save you time)

> **If it’s a directory tree, it must always be inside a fenced code block.**

Prefer:
- ` ```text ` → best
- ` ```bash ` → acceptable
- ❌ ` ```yaml ` → misleading
- ❌ no fence → broken rendering

---

## Next recommended step (logical progression)

Once this is fixed, the next clean step is to:
- Add a **short descriptive paragraph above the tree**
- Then link **engineering-research-wiki** from this README

If you want, I can:
- Rewrite the **full `technical-wiki-hub/README.md`** cleanly
- Align both READMEs stylistically
- Prepare your **GitHub profile README** to showcase both repos

Just tell me what you want to do next.
