# 🌐 Networking Basics for Engineers

Foundational networking concepts for engineers dealing with systems, automation, or simulations.

---

## 🧱 OSI Model Layers

1. Physical – cables, radio, optical
2. Data Link – MAC, switches
3. Network – IP, routing
4. Transport – TCP, UDP
5. Session – APIs, sockets
6. Presentation – encoding
7. Application – HTTP, DNS

## 📡 Key Concepts

- **IP Addressing (IPv4/6)**  
- **Subnetting (CIDR)**  
- **MAC vs IP**  
- **Ports and Protocols (e.g. 22 = SSH)**  
- **TCP vs UDP** — reliability vs speed

## 🧪 Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `ping` | Reachability |
| `traceroute` | Path to host |
| `netstat` | Port usage |
| `tcpdump` | Raw packet capture |
| `Wireshark` | GUI packet analysis |

## 📘 Example

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
traceroute www.google.com
